Purpose:

The main purpose of this programming assignment is to revise the topics that we have
covered in the first three weeks including fundamentals of C programming, conditional 
statements and repetitive statements. In this assignment, you will also practice character 
data types.


Description:

An encoder is a digital circuit that performs the inverse operation of a decoder. An octal to 
binary encoder consists of eight input lines and three output lines. Each input line corresponds 
to each octal digit and three outputs generate corresponding binary code. In encoders, it is 
to be assumed that only one input is active or has a value 1 at any given time. In this 
programming exercise, your task is to write a command-line application that takes the input 
to an encoder, and returns the three output generated by an encoder.

The truth table for the encoder is:

When the user first runs the program, you will display the following menu:
Welcome to Octal-to-Binary Encoder!
(1) Compute and Display the outputs
(2) Quit
Depending on the option given by the user, your program will work as follows:

If the user selects option 2 (Quit), then your program will stop.

If the user enters an invalid input for base 2 or base 10 then your program will display “invalid 
number in base 2/10” and will ask the user to re-enter the value again.

If the user inputs is <8 digits in base 2 then your program will display “You entered less than 8 
bits! Please try again!” and will ask the user to re-enter the value again.
